# WHEN USER-CENTRIC NETWORK MEETS MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING:CHALLENGES AND OPTIMIZATION
Simulation code and mathematic details of our paper in IEEE Communications Magazine --- WHEN USER-CENTRIC NETWORK MEETS MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING:CHALLENGES AND OPTIMIZATION

**Abstract:** As an emergent computing paradigm, mobile edge computing (MEC) can provide users with strong computing, storage,
and communication services by moving the server to the user
side. In recent years, applications such as virtual reality (VR)
and augmented reality (AR) brought higher requirements on
transmission and computing capabilities. However, in the traditional cellular-based MEC, users at the edge of the cell will
suffer a severe signal attenuation and inter-cell interference,
leading to a great reduction in achievable rate and prone
to transmission outage and offloading failure. To overcome
this limitation, we combine the user-centric network (UCN)
with MEC computing services and proposed a novel framework called user-centric MEC (UCMEC). Through the dense
deployment of access points (APs), UCMEC can provide
users with efficient, reliable, low-cost user-centric wireless
transmission and edge computing services. To further exploit
the benefits of UCMEC, we jointly optimize the task partition,
transmit power control, and computing resource allocation
decision to minimize the total energy consumption under
delay constraints. Simulation results show that our proposed ptimization scheme can bring users lower energy consumption, delay, and higher successful offloading probability than
traditional MEC.
